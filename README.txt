# FooDOxS Database README

## Overview

The FooDOxS database is structured as a spreadsheet, with each row representing an individual food item and each column serving as either a group variable or a dependent variable (i.e., DOxS species). The following key details are provided to assist users in navigating and interpreting the data:

1. **Detailed Description (Column A):** This column offers a comprehensive description of each item, including processing time and/or temperature, storage details, and any other relevant information reported in the original study.

2. **NOVA Classification (Column B):** The NOVA classification assigned to each food item is outlined in this column.

3. **Serving Size (Column C):** If reported in the original study, the serving size of each food item is provided in this column.

4. **WWEIA Food Code (Column D):** This column includes the WWEIA food code corresponding to sub-food categories.

5. **In-Text Citations (Column E):** The in-text citation of references is included in this column.

6. **Additional Notes (Column F):** This column may contain supplementary notes on the food item if present.

From Column G onward, DOxS concentration is reported as mean and standard deviation in separate columns. Users can leverage filtering options to view data related to specific Food Groups, Main Food Categories, NOVA groups, or references.

## Accessing and Filtering Data

To enhance usability, users can filter the dataset based on the desired column, allowing for focused exploration of food items associated with specific attributes. Simply apply the desired filter to access relevant information.
